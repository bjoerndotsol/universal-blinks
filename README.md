# Universal Blinks

Universal Blinks is a wrapper solution that makes Solana Blinks work seamlessly across all platforms, especially on mobile devices and social media.

## The Problem

When sharing Solana Blinks on social media, you encounter several issues:

1. **No Open Graph (OG) data**: Blinks don't display proper previews on social platforms
2. **Mobile compatibility**: Blinks don't work properly on mobile devices unless opened in an in-app browser from your wallet
3. **Poor user experience**: Users often can't interact with Blinks as intended

## The Solution

Universal Blinks acts as an intelligent wrapper that:

- **On Mobile**: Opens a user-friendly interface where users can select their preferred wallet (Solflare or Phantom) and opens the Blink via deeplink/universal link
- **On Desktop**: Redirects to the dial.to interstitial page for optimal experience
- **Everywhere**: Provides consistent functionality across all platforms and devices
